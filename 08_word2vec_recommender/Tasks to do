TODO:
-	Phrases tagging and replacing the words – ex. Well done becomes well_done. PPDB is a good source for the same
-	Named Entity Recognition
-	NNP Phrases tagging , ex. International Institute of Information Technology
-	Tagging item details before/after each streaming sentence, to maintain context. Like for Item X, the review may be ‘I loved it.’ This converts to <Item X> I loved it </Item X>
-	Filters for sentiment, weighting outcomes by sentiment.
-	Gender Detection
-	Associate the headers description with pricing, reviews and embeddings

A. PRE-PROCESSING:
     1.	No reviews less than 10 words – find how much is getting cleaned up to decide the threshold
     2.	Create price ranges – 10, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 99999
     3.	Tag <PRICE> <CATEGORY> <PRODUCT ID> Title + ‘.’ + Review <PRODUCT ID> <CATEGORY> <PRICE> 

B. TOKENIZER:
     1.	Phrase & Idioms Tagger - Scrape & load to Redis : bottom line - > bottom_line
     2.	Proper Noun Tagger: Donald Trump - > Donald_Trump

C. NAMED ENTITY TAGGER:
     1. Pre-process the Wiki Titles to load into Redis from enwiki-latest-all-titles.gz (Download from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/): 
	- remove "_" and keep " "
	- remove words between ()
	- remove gibberish 
	- remove words with exclamation marks
	- split on comma and make into different words
	- remove words starting with small letters
	- remove duplicates
     2. Create NNP Parser to identify nouns
     
D. RECORD METADATA
     1. Number of reviews processed
     2. Exceptions caught
     3. Total time taken
